# Binance hackathon front-end

This repository contains a proof of concept of the front-end developed for the Heretics team during the Binance hackathon.

## Objective

The objective of this proof of concept is to demonstrate the viability of an intuitive and user-friendly user interface for Heretics during their streamings and their fans.

The project should meet the following achievements:

- Heretics makes use of their fan token and blockchain technology.
- Fans engage with Heretics by holding and staking their tokens once Heretics allows staking (Ex: During their events).
- Viewer retention should be boosted as staking rewards lower within time until random (or selected by Heretic) staking boosts are available during the event.

## Features

- Allow fans to stake their tokens.
- Allow Heretics and allowed bnb addresses (moderators) to open/close the staking period.
- Allow Heretics and allowed bnb addresses (moderators) to boost staking rewards during selected periods of time (ex: Ads break).
