# Binance hackathon front-end

This repository contains a proof of concept of the front-end developed for the Heretics team during the Binance hackathon.

## Objective

The objective of this proof of concept is to demonstrate the viability of an intuitive and user-friendly user interface for Heretics and their fans during their streamings. The following interface would allow Heretics's fans to engage with Heretics while making use of blockchain technology and increasing at the same time viewer retention and engagement during events being streamed.

The project should meet the following achievements:

- Heretics makes use of their fan token and blockchain technology.
- Fans engage with Heretics by holding and staking their tokens once Heretics allows staking (Ex: During their events).
- Viewer retention should be boosted as staking rewards lower within time until random (or selected by Heretic) staking boosts are available during the event.

### Purpose

Above objectives should allow:

- Reward the fans who keep watching a Heretics event for the longest time
- Reward the fans who remain the most devoted to Heretics over time
- Reward fans who actively view Heretics events

In this way we ensure that those who view Heretics events want to actively view them and want to come back the next day.

## Features

- Allow fans to stake their tokens.
- Allow Heretics and allowed bnb addresses (moderators) to open/close the staking period.
- Allow Heretics and allowed bnb addresses (moderators) to boost staking rewards during selected periods of time (ex: Ads break).
